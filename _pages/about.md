I am an economist at the U.S. Treasury Office of Tax Analysis. I received my Ph.D. from Harvard University in 2023, with a disciplinary focus in environmental, public, and labor economics. My research examines how climate change and air pollution exacerbate social inequality and the opportunities for policy to mitigate these impacts. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a research assistant at Resources for the Future. I graduated *summa cum laude* from Pomona College, with a B.A. in Economics. My research has been published in the *American Journal of Agricultural Economics*, *RAND Journal of Economics*, *Energy Policy*, *Environmental Law Reporter*, and the *Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society*.
